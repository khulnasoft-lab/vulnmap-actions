# Vulnmap Python (3.8)  Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for using [Vulnmap](https://khulnasoft.com/VulnmapGH) to check for
vulnerabilities in your Python-3.8 projects. This Action is based on the [Vulnmap CLI][cli-gh] and you can use [all of its options and capabilities][cli-ref] with the `args`.

 > Note: The examples shared below reflect how Vulnmap github actions can be used. Vulnmap requires Python to have downloaded the dependencies before running or triggering the Vulnmap checks.
                          > The Python image checks and installs deps only if the manifest files are present in the current path (from where action is being triggered)
                          > 1. If pip is present on the current path , and Vulnmap finds a requirements.txt file, then Vulnmap runs pip install -r requirements.txt.
                          > 2. If pipenv is present on the current path, and Vulnmap finds a Pipfile without a Pipfile.lock, then Vulnmap runs pipenv update
                          > 3. If pyproject.toml is present in the current path and Vulnmap does not find poetry.lock then Vulnmap runs pip install poetry
                          >
                          > If manifest files are present under any location other root then they MUST be installed prior to running Vulnmap.

You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Python using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/python-3.8@master
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
```

## Properties

The Vulnmap Python Action has properties which are passed to the underlying image. These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property | Default | Description                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| args     |         | Override the default arguments to the Vulnmap image. See [Vulnmap CLI reference for all options][cli-ref] |
| command  | test    | Specify which command to run, for instance test or monitor                                          |
| json     | false   | In addition to the stdout, save the results as vulnmap.json                                            |

For example, you can choose to only report on high severity vulnerabilities.

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Python using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/python-3.8@master
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
```

## Uploading Vulnmap scan results to GitHub Code Scanning

Using `--sarif-file-output` [Vulnmap CLI flag][cli-ref] and the [official GitHub SARIF upload action](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github), you can upload Vulnmap scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning.



The Vulnmap Action will fail when vulnerabilities are found. This would prevent the SARIF upload action from running, so we need to introduce a [continue-on-error](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error) option like this:

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Python using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/python-3.8@master
        continue-on-error: true # To make sure that SARIF upload gets called
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --sarif-file-output=vulnmap.sarif
      - name: Upload result to GitHub Code Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: vulnmap.sarif
```
