# Vulnmap Ruby Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for using [Vulnmap](https://khulnasoft.com/VulnmapGH) to check for
vulnerabilities in your Ruby projects. This Action is based on the [Vulnmap CLI][cli-gh] and you can use [all of its options and capabilities][cli-ref] with the `args`.


You can use the Action as follows:

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Ruby using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/ruby@master
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
```

## Properties

The Vulnmap Ruby Action has properties which are passed to the underlying image. These are passed to the action using `with`.

| Property | Default | Description                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| args     |         | Override the default arguments to the Vulnmap image. See [Vulnmap CLI reference for all options][cli-ref] |
| command  | test    | Specify which command to run, for instance test or monitor                                          |
| json     | false   | In addition to the stdout, save the results as vulnmap.json                                            |

For example, you can choose to only report on high severity vulnerabilities.

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Ruby using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/ruby@master
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high
```

## Uploading Vulnmap scan results to GitHub Code Scanning

Using `--sarif-file-output` [Vulnmap CLI flag][cli-ref] and the [official GitHub SARIF upload action](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github), you can upload Vulnmap scan results to the GitHub Code Scanning.

![Vulnmap results as a SARIF output uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning](../_templates/sarif-example.png)

The Vulnmap Action will fail when vulnerabilities are found. This would prevent the SARIF upload action from running, so we need to introduce a [continue-on-error](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepscontinue-on-error) option like this:

```yaml
name: Example workflow for Ruby using Vulnmap
on: push
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Run Vulnmap to check for vulnerabilities
        uses: khulnasoft-lab/vulnmap-actions/ruby@master
        continue-on-error: true # To make sure that SARIF upload gets called
        env:
          VULNMAP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VULNMAP_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --sarif-file-output=vulnmap.sarif
      - name: Upload result to GitHub Code Scanning
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: vulnmap.sarif
```
